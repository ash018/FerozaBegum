						<p>	Feroza Begum formally started learning music at the age of 13 from Chitta Roy in Kolkata. After one year, Feroza Begum started her training in music under the direct supervision of the legendary music director of the Indian subcontinent, Kamal Dasgupta. When Feroza Begum was only 14, the famous Columbia Records in Kolkata published her first music album. At that time, Feroza Begum was regularly performing at the Kolkata Radio. Her radio performances encompassed a wide range of music genres such as Islamic Song, Geet, Ghazal, Bhajan, Modern Bengali Song, and Nazrul Sangeet. The world renowned record company His Master’s Voice then started publishing one after another many of her gramophone records in Bengali, Hindi, and Urdu. Among them, Feroza Begum’s renditions of the most popular songs were “Amar Moner Sagor Kinare”, “Kabhu Pai Kabhu Pai Na”, “Tumi Jodi Chaho More”, “Ekti Heridoy Gaan Geye Jaay”, “Tum Bhulaye Na Gaye”, “Kyon Tum Se Mujh Ko Pyar Hay”,  “Kab Tak Yeh Pareshani”, “Thehro Thehro Zara”.

                                                    By then, Feroza Begum had started her training in music directly from Kazi Nazrul Islam. In spite of being a very famous vocal artist at that time for her renditions of Modern Bengali Songs and Urdu Songs, Feroza Begum was drawn to Nazrul Sangeet and started concentrating entirely on Nazrul’s songs. Through rigorous practice, she could adapt an original style of singing that brought Nazrul Sangeet near to the hearts of the common people. She took her struggle in popularizing Nazrul’s songs to the heights of a movement in music. Through this movement, Nazrul’s modern songs and Nazrul Geeti, previously ignored by the general audiences, appeared as a new genre of Nazrul Sangeet. Feroza Begum became known by then as the “rebel disciple of the rebel poet”.

                                                <p>
                                                    At that time, all the renowned vocal artists in Kolkata were recording Nazrul Sangeet under the direction and supervision of Feroza Begum. She herself has rendered and recorded over seven hundred songs. The music legend has 36 Long Play records to her credit and has made 150 stage performances at the Mahajati Sadan and the Rabindra Sadan in Kolkata.

                                                    The Government of Bangladesh has honoured Feroza Begum with ‘Independence Award’ in 1979.

                                                    A true artist does not find success in awards and accolades. She wishes to reign over people’s hearts. Feroza Begum has acquired permanent space in the hearts of millions of her fans. After her death, at a programme, an ardent fan of Feroza Begum had once said that after the death of Kazi Nazrul Islam, everyone thought that if not the poet is here but Feroza Begum is here; but when Feroza Begum had died it seemed that Kazi Nazrul Islam has finally passed away. Every conscious moment of the 88 years of the music legend’s life shines bright with her struggle, her quest for excellence in music.  She had dedicated her life to collect, promote, and present Nazrul Sangeet to a wider audience. Feroza Begum has seen its success in her lifetime. Her quest for music made her a living legend.
